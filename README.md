## Overview
This project is a simple shell implemented in Go that I designed to learn and improve on the language as well as to understand on a low level as to how a shell works.

## Features
- Execute basic shell commands
- Script execution with `.sh` files
- Lightweight and fast

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/KingrogKDR/my-shell-go.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd my-shell-go
    ```
3. **Build the project:**
       *Since the file is built as the shell-script executes, allow executable permissions.*
    ```sh
    chmod +x shell.sh
    ```

## Usage
1. **Run the shell-script to build and start the shell:**
    ```sh
    ./shell.sh
    ```
2. **Execute commands:**
    You can type and execute your commands in the shell as you would in any other shell environment.
